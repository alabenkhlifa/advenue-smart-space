# AdVenue - Missing Features Analysis

**Last Updated:** October 23, 2025

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of features that are currently missing from the AdVenue platform, organized by priority and impact.

---

## üî¥ CRITICAL MISSING FEATURES

### 1. Payment & Billing System (Completely Missing)

**Current State:** The platform has NO actual monetization infrastructure. Only mock revenue calculation exists ($0.01/impression demo rate).

**What's Missing:**
- Payment processing integration (Stripe, PayPal, Square, etc.)
- Advertiser payment system for campaigns
- Screen owner payout system
- Billing cycles and invoicing
- Transaction history and receipts
- Subscription/pricing tiers
- Payment configuration (API keys, webhooks)
- Revenue sharing logic between platform and screen owners

**Impact:** Without this, AdVenue cannot generate real revenue. This is the #1 blocker to monetization.

**Technical Notes:**
- No payment libraries in `package.json`
- Mock function exists: `calculateScreenRevenue()` in `src/lib/analytics.ts`
- Screen Owner Dashboard shows "demo rate" revenue estimates only

---

### 2. Content Moderation & Approval System (Completely Missing)

**Current State:** No safeguards against inappropriate content. Campaigns go "active" immediately without review.

**What's Missing:**
- Admin role and admin dashboard
- Campaign approval workflow
- Content flagging/reporting system
- Compliance checks and content policy enforcement
- Campaign rejection system
- Moderation queue for pending content
- Content guidelines and terms of service enforcement
- Audit trail for moderation actions

**Impact:** Risk of inappropriate ads, legal liability, and brand damage for venues. No quality control.

**Technical Notes:**
- Only two user roles exist: `'advertiser' | 'screen-owner'`
- Campaign status: `'draft' | 'active' | 'paused' | 'completed'` - no "pending approval"
- Only basic file validation exists (file size, type)

---

## üü° HIGH-PRIORITY MISSING FEATURES

### 3. Advanced Analytics & Visualization

**Current State:** Data is collected comprehensively but visualization is minimal. Recharts library is installed but unused!

**What's Missing:**
- Interactive charts and graphs (line charts, bar charts, pie charts)
- Data export functionality (CSV, PDF reports)
- CTR prominently displayed (function exists but underutilized)
- Period-over-period comparisons (this week vs last week)
- ROI calculations and cost-per-impression tracking
- Time-of-day heatmaps
- Audience behavior patterns
- Customizable date ranges in UI
- Scheduled/automated reports

**Impact:** Users cannot visualize their data effectively. Missing professional reporting features that competitors offer.

**Quick Wins:**
- Recharts (v2.15.4) is already installed
- Chart UI components exist at `src/components/ui/chart.tsx`
- `calculateScanConversionRate()` function exists but isn't prominently displayed

---

### 4. Geographic & Audience Targeting

**Current State:** Location data is collected but not used for ad targeting. Only category filtering exists.

**What's Missing:**
- Location-based ad targeting (city, region, country)
- Demographic targeting (age, gender, income)
- Venue type targeting (restaurant vs. gym vs. mall)
- Audience interest targeting
- Behavioral targeting
- Time-of-day audience targeting
- Weather-based targeting
- Event-based targeting (concerts, sports games, etc.)

**Impact:** Limited targeting capabilities reduce campaign effectiveness and advertiser value.

**Technical Notes:**
- Location data IS collected: `region`, `city`, `country` in impressions
- Venue metadata exists in auth system
- Infrastructure ready, just needs targeting logic

---

### 5. Notifications & Communication System

**Current State:** No notification system exists. Users have no way to receive alerts.

**What's Missing:**
- Email notifications
- In-app notifications
- Push notifications (optional)
- Campaign status alerts (approved/rejected, completed)
- Budget alerts (campaign spending thresholds)
- Performance milestone alerts (1000 impressions, high CTR, etc.)
- Screen offline/online alerts for owners
- Payment notifications (invoices, payouts)
- System announcements

**Impact:** Poor user experience. Users must manually check for updates.

---

## üü¢ MEDIUM-PRIORITY ENHANCEMENTS

### 6. Campaign Performance Optimization

**What's Missing:**
- A/B testing capabilities
- Auto-pause underperforming campaigns
- Budget pacing and daily spend limits
- Bid-based pricing model
- Dynamic pricing based on screen performance
- Recommended optimizations based on campaign data
- Automatic creative rotation based on performance
- Frequency capping per viewer

**Impact:** Advertisers cannot optimize campaigns effectively. Platform misses opportunity to improve results.

---

### 7. Advanced Screen Management

**What's Missing:**
- Screen groups/networks for bulk management
- Screen health monitoring and uptime tracking
- Remote screen configuration
- Preview mode before publishing changes
- Screen scheduling (planned maintenance, special hours)
- Multi-screen content coordination
- Screen templates for quick setup
- Screen performance benchmarking

**Impact:** Managing multiple screens is tedious. No centralized control for multi-venue owners.

---

### 8. User Experience Improvements

**What's Missing:**
- Campaign duplication/cloning feature
- Campaign templates library
- Bulk media upload
- Media library management (organize, tag, search)
- Campaign search and advanced filters
- Drag-and-drop media management
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Dark mode
- Onboarding tutorial
- Help center / documentation

**Impact:** Users spend more time on repetitive tasks. Steeper learning curve.

---

### 9. Integration & API

**What's Missing:**
- Public REST API for third-party integrations
- API authentication and rate limiting
- Webhook support
- Integration with ad networks (Google Ads, Meta Ads)
- CRM integrations (HubSpot, Salesforce)
- Analytics integrations (Google Analytics)
- Zapier integration
- SDK for developers
- API documentation

**Impact:** Platform operates in isolation. Cannot leverage ecosystem integrations.

**Technical Notes:**
- API structure exists at `src/lib/api/` but is for internal use only
- No authentication layer for external API access

---

### 10. Legal & Compliance

**What's Missing:**
- Terms of service acceptance flow
- Privacy policy acceptance
- Content policy documentation
- GDPR compliance features
- Data retention policies
- User data export (for GDPR requests)
- Right to be forgotten implementation
- Cookie consent management
- Age verification for certain content
- Regional compliance (CCPA, etc.)

**Impact:** Legal risk. Non-compliance with data protection regulations.
